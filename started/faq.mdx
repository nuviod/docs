  <Accordion title="Can I purchase an open-source version of the script?">
    At the moment, no. The resource is protected by the system developed by [cfx.re](https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-asset-escrow-for-your-resources/4777151), which prevents the source code from being distributed or sold in an open form. This ensures stability, integrity, and compliance with the platform’s protection rules.

  <Accordion title="Can I use lower versions of scripts?">
    Yes, you can use lower versions of scripts, but please note that if any issues occur, support may be limited since these versions haven’t been fully tested with nv-core.
