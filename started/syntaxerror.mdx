title: "Syntax Errors: Cause & Solution"
---

**Issue:** Users may encounter the **Error: syntax error near ’\<\\1\>’** during file transfers. This typically occurs when transferring files that use the FXAP encryption method, such as `.rpd` files, which are prone to corruption if not transferred correctly.

**Cause:** The error is caused by improper handling of encrypted files during transfer. Default transfer modes like ASCII can alter file contents, resulting in syntax errors when the file is read.

**Solution:**

1. When using FileZilla or similar FTP clients, set the **Transfer Type** to **Binary** under the transfer settings. This ensures the file is transmitted byte-for-byte without alteration.
2. For safer transfer, especially for FXAP-encrypted files, consider compressing files into `.zip`, `.rar`, or `.7z` archives before transfer. This reduces the risk of corruption and maintains integrity.
3. Keep your **Artifacts version as up-to-date as possible**, since newer releases often include fixes for transfer and compatibility issues with encrypted file formats.

Following these steps will minimize errors and ensure encrypted files are transferred without corruption.
