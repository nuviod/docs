description: "This core was built to unify player interactions across different systems without adding unnecessary complexity. Its purpose is to manage how interactions are registered, grouped, and displayed, ensuring that input, distance checks, and UI logic work together seamlessly. By centralizing this flow, the core allows supported resources to integrate naturally, communicate cleanly, and remain focused on their own logic while interactions are handled smoothly in the background."
