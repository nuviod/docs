title: "Examples"
description: "This page provides practical examples to demonstrate how the core is intended to be used in real scenarios. Each example focuses on a specific interaction type and shows how systems can register actions, define distances, and respond to player input without managing the underlying flow. The goal is to highlight common patterns and best practices, making it easier to understand how different resources can integrate with the core and work together in a consistent, predictable way."
